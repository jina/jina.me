## Running Locally

This site is built with [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a Ruby framework
for building static sites.

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/),
[rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed
before you can run the site locally.

If the above dependencies are installed, in your command line of preference,
navigate to the project repo and run:

```
bundle install
middleman
```


Thanks!
