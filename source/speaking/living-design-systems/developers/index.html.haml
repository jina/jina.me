      This presentation may contain forward-looking statements that involve
      risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. If any such uncertainties
      materialize or if any of the assumptions proves incorrect, the results
      of salesforce.com, inc. could differ materially from the results
      expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. All
      statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed
      forward-looking, including any projections of product or service
      availability, subscriber growth, earnings, revenues, or other financial
      items and any statements regarding strategies or plans of management for
      future operations, statements of belief, any statements concerning new,
      planned, or upgraded services or technology developments and customer
      contracts or use of our services.

      The risks and uncertainties referred to above include – but are not
      limited to – risks associated with developing and delivering new
      functionality for our service, new products and services, our new
      business model, our past operating losses, possible fluctuations in our
      operating results and rate of growth, interruptions or delays in our Web
      hosting, breach of our security measures, the outcome of any litigation,
      risks associated with completed and any possible mergers and
      acquisitions, the immature market in which we operate, our relatively
      limited operating history, our ability to expand, retain, and motivate
      our employees and manage our growth, new releases of our service and
      successful customer deployment, our limited history reselling
      non-salesforce.com products, and utilization and selling to larger
      enterprise customers. Further information on potential factors that
      could affect the financial results of salesforce.com, inc. is included
      in our annual report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year and in
      our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the most recent fiscal quarter.
