  an event in which there are two hours of speed design mentoring and

  was a pretty great event!

  When I walked in, I was very impressed. I saw a huge room full of an
  energetic crowd. At many tables throughout the space, there were attendees
  meeting 1-on-1 with design mentors. It was speed mentoring, so everyone
  had a time slot they signed up for to meet. Everyone seemed very talented
  and passionate. I saw some people getting feedback on their projects, and
  some just having a conversation. It looked pretty fun.
