title: "Card Review: Flesh + Bones"

:markdown
  [Flesh&nbsp;+&nbsp;Bones](http://dualoriginals.com/products/cards) is the
  most recent deck of playing cards I have received for my collection,
  so&nbsp;I figured I would review this one first. This&nbsp;is a deck
  hand-illustrated by [Dual&nbsp;Originals](http://dualoriginals.com/) for
  [DeckStarter](https://deckstarter.com/), and&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;backer.

  Admittedly, I&nbsp;was very frustrated because my order was really late.
  But&nbsp;after some back-and-forth over support and social media,
  DeckStarter&nbsp;made it right with me. I&nbsp;can be a little impatient for
  things I&rsquo;ve paid for, but&nbsp;once I received the deck I was very
  happy and it was worth the&nbsp;wait.

  ## The Box

    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/box-1/tablet.jpg", alt: "Box Photo 1"
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/box-2/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/box-2/tablet.jpg", alt: "Box Photo 2"

:markdown
  I love the design used for box. It&nbsp;is minimalist &mdash; just black and
  white. It&nbsp;reminds me of the Bristol Board I used to print on a lot in
  art&nbsp;school.

  ## Card Backs

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/back/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/back/tablet.jpg", alt: "Back"

:markdown
  Most decks I have sport beautiful backs and have boring fronts. While&nbsp;I
  think the backs of these cards are very nice, they&nbsp;are less interesting
  than the fronts, which&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;soon.

  ## Number Cards

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/numbers/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/numbers/tablet.jpg", alt: "Numbers"

:markdown
  The front of the number cards are smaller numbers and pips, a&nbsp;slight
  departure from the standard style. I&nbsp;like the&nbsp;simplicity.

  ## The Aces

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/aces/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/aces/tablet.jpg", alt: "Aces"

:markdown
  Usually only the Ace&nbsp;<i>of</i>&nbsp;Spades has a fancy design.
  I&nbsp;love that all four aces get a nice&nbsp;illustration.

  ## The Face Cards

  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/jacks/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/jacks/tablet.jpg", alt: "Jacks"
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/queens/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/queens/tablet.jpg", alt: "Queens"
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/kings/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/kings/tablet.jpg", alt: "Kings"

:markdown
  I love these face cards. Instead&nbsp;of typical royal humans in
  fancy clothes, we&nbsp;get a range of monsters, including&nbsp;mermaids,
  dragons, unicorns,&nbsp;etc.

  ## Jokers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Other Cards

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/extras/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/extras/tablet.jpg", alt: "Extras"

:markdown
  The Jokers are stunning. I&nbsp;like the contrast between the two.
  One&nbsp;card is heavy with a skeleton with long hair filling most of the
  card. The&nbsp;other joker is stark and clean with the butterfly (or moth?)
  in the&nbsp;middle.

  Finally, the&nbsp;deck also comes with information cards for both
  [Art&nbsp;<i>of</i>&nbsp;Play](http://www.artofplay.com/) and
  Dual&nbsp;Originals.
